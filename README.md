# Dry-Beans-Classification

After cleaning the data, and splitting into a training and test set, grid search was used to explore the best model
among Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Classifications. The best model was then
scored on the test set using f1-macro and SVC was decidedly the best model.
